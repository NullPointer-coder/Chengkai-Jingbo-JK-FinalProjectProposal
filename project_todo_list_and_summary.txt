## App Purpose ##

The Smart Recipe Recommender is designed to help users make the most out of their available ingredients by recommending recipes based on whatâ€™s already in their fridge or pantry. Users can enter the ingredients they currently have, and the app will suggest recipes that can be made with those ingredients, along with personalized recipe recommendations based on the user's preferences and dietary restrictions. The app aims to reduce food waste, save time in meal planning, and provide a customized cooking experience.

3. Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions:

4. Offline Functionality: 
	- Recipes and user data are cached locally, allowing users to browse previously viewed recipes even without an internet connection.

5. Push Notifications:
